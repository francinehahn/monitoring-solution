<h1 align="center">Monitoring Solution</h1>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èAbout the project
In this project, I proposed 2 different approaches to monitor an application.

### In the first approach, there are 2 endpoints:
- POST endpoint that receives data every minute with information about the number of transactions in the previous minute and inserts it in the database. The possible transaction types are: approved, denied, reversed, failed, processing, backend_reversed and refunded. Below is an example of the body of the request (all of the information is optional):

![request-body](./img/request_body_ex.png)

- GET endpoint that is requested every hour and gets information from the database about the last hour. Below is an example of the response of the http request:

![response-http-request](./img/response.png)

With this information, the endpoint calculates the z-score of each average rates and based on this information it sends an alert to the team when the failed transaction rates, the denied transaction rates and/or the reversed transaction rates are above normal.

### In the second approach, there are also 2 endpoints:
- POST endpoint (the same as the first approach)
- GET endpoint that also requests information from the database and receives the same response as the endpoint in the first approach. The difference here is that instead of calculating z-scores, I used a decision tree to predict the expected rates of each transaction status for that specific hour.
- Based on the predicitons, the endpoint sends and alert to the team when the failed transaction rates, the denied transaction rates and/or the reversed transaction rates are above normal.
